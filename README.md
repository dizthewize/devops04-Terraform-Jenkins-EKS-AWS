### Why use Terraform?
- perfect tool for automation
- platform independent and not specifically tied to AWS like cloudformation
- modules assist in creating all the natural resources for creating an eks infrastructure
- version control (history in the form of the terraform state)
- simple cleanup instead of multiple steps instead of:
  - having to create an eks iam role and ec2 role for node groups
- Team collaboration is easier
- Simpler clean up
- Simpler replication of infrastructure is possible
